# Comparing Two Implementations üî¨
## üîç Part 1: Find Tests with Different Results 

![image](Lab5Part1.png)
Figure1: Screenshot of terminal showing `diff` used to show the differences of two files in a stylized format

In general, I found the differences in tests using `diff` to help me list out all the differences between two test files. I add `> resultsDiffs.txt` after the `diff` command to put all the output in a separate file. Then I print out the file which saved the differences.

- The first difference I chose
![image](Lab5Part1.1.png)
As shown in the picture, there is a difference between line 230 of two files.

- The second difference I chose
![image](Lab5Part1.2.png)
As shown in the picture, there is another difference between line884 of my test file and line 882 of joe's.

Then I use `vim` to figure out the corresponding test files which have these differences. I enter `:set number` to better find the specific lines. 

- The first test file with difference is test file `201.md`

- The second test file with difference is test file `496.md`

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 2: Find and Address the Problem
### Difference #1: `test-files/201.md\`
- Test file contents:
![image](Lab5Part2Test1.png)
-My output: `[]`\
-Joe's output: `[baz]`\
-Expected output(Screenshot of [CommonMark demo site](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/)):
![image](Lab5Part2TestExpected.png)
-Correct implementation: My Repo

- `_bug` for the first difference in Joe's code\
As the screenshot of the expected output shown, the content in test file `201.md` is not a valid link. Because there is something between the close bracket and the open parenthesis.
![image](Lab5Part2Test1Bug.png)
The reason I think is that there is no check for space or characters between `]` and `(` at lines 75-76. We could add a condition to check if the first `(` index and the last `]` only has a difference of 1.

### Difference #2: `test-files/496.md\`
- Test file contents:
![image](Lab5Part2Test2.png)
-My output: `[foo(and(bar]`\
-Joe's output: `[]`\
-Expected output:
![image](Lab5Part2Test2Expected.png)
-Correct implementation: Joe's Repo

- `_bug~` for the second difference in my code\
As the screeenshot of the expected output shown, the content in test file `496.md` is also not a valid link input. Because there are too many open parenthesis inserted in the content. There is one missing its own closed parenthesis.
![image](Lab5Part2Test2Bug.png)
In my code, there is nowhere to check if the parenthesis are paired. When finding the the `closeParenthesis`, I should have another method to find the real last one.

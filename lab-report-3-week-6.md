This screenshot shows where my config file is and what content my config file has.\
I am so lazy so I changed my alias to `login` 🤣

### How do I edit `config` file ✏️
- use `nano ~/.ssh/config` to continue editing my config file.
- copied past what lab writeup has and changed my alias to `login` after this page shows up.
- Use `control + O` and it asked me to confirm my file name and just click `enter`. 
- Use `control + X` to exit this page.
